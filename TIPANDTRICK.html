                      Many factors hold your gaming up. Probably the most common reason is that PC gaming is far more complicated compared with Console gaming. There are lots of possible PC configurations the user may have. QA testers can’t test all possible configurations, as it is impossible to take into account all of them.

                                What is Mobile Legends? Mobile Legends is a mobile MOBA – think League of Legends or Dota 2. For those unfamiliar with the genre, they’re ‘multiplayer online battle arenas’ where you and your teammates choose from a roster of heroes and set out to defend your base while ensuring the total obliteration of the enemy base. They require strategy, team coordination, mechanical skill, and knowledge of a large library of heroes, items, and abilities.

                                Don’t worry, though, as we’re here to help you get started with our Mobile Legends guide.
